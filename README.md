# Salt And Pepper Recipes :bento:

__Salt and Pepper Recipes__ is Java based recipe program that allows users to add, edit, delete, sort, search,
and scale recipes. __Salt and Pepper Recipes__ uses __Java Swing__ for GUI and a text file and
folder database system for storing recipes.

## Why a Recipe Program? :thinking:

Cooking is one of my favorite hobbies, and I wanted to create something that would give a
way for people to organize recipes if they happen to have a lot of paper recipes. Food
brings people together, and what better way to share food than by sharing recipes!

## Installing

Simply download the __jar file__ in the __Artifacts__ folder and run!

### Note

Salt and Pepper Recipes uses a __Recipes__ folder to hold recipe files. Text files will be
created and placed inside the __Recipes__ folder. The __Recipes__ folder will be created
in the directory of the __jar file__.

## About

Project was used as submission for the __International Baccalaureate__
program as part of the __Computer Science Internal Assessment__. Project was designed
for a client Gary. Documentation for said submission is located in the 
__Documentation__ folder. I would not advise copying this submission for your own in the
IB program.
